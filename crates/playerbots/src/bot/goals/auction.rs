//! Auction: list the goods the bot came by honestly at the auction house, now and then buy a

//! # The visit
//!
//! ```text
//! Plan ─► Walk ─► Find ─► Survey ─► (Price ─► Post)×n ─► Cancel? ─► Browse ─► Buy ─► Verify ─► Linger
//!         to the   the NPC  own lots   search the market,    an overpriced   look at   buyout    own lots   a few
//!         nearest  in view  (client    ask a little under    lot, rarely     the lots  one lot   again      seconds
//!         auctioneer        id)        it, post 48 h
//! ```
//!
//! * **Plan**: the stacks to list ([`pick_stacks`]: whole bag stacks of items the provenance ledger
//!   calls the bot's own, tradable, above a reserve of what it may use itself, worth a trip) and
//!   whether it may buy (never while `bots.gm_bootstrap` is on: the gold would be GM-minted), then
//!   the nearest auctioneer it can walk to ([`aa_world::World::nearest_auctioneer`]).
//! * **Walk / Find**: to within 2.2 m of the NPC. Every request carries the NPC's object id twice;
//!   the server wants an auctioneer within 5 m and answers error 388 otherwise, then the bot
//!   interacts with the NPC and asks again.
//! * **Survey**: a search with the bot's own character id lists its lots. A lot the bot knew that is
//!   gone was sold, expired or cancelled; its result mail is expected (see the detectors).
//! * **Price / Post**: for each stack a search by the exact item name sorted by buyout gives the
//!   market ([`price::quote`]); the ask is [`price::ask`] (a little under the market, never below
//!   what beats the vendor after the 10% tax and the up-front fee), 48 hours. The server answers
//!   `SCAuctionPosted`, error 241 (cannot pay) or, for a refusal it does not report, nothing.
//! * **Browse / Buy**: lots priced far under the vendor price, or items the bot can use at no more
//!   than a shop asks, within a small budget, are bought out.
//! * **Linger**: the bot stays a little, like a player reading the list.
//!
//! Results come by mail (types 13 to 16); collecting them is a background duty ([`duty`]) that runs
//! on every brain tick. A visit happens at most every [`VISIT_GAP_MS`].
//!
//! # Detectors
//!
//! [`report`] has the issue reports: a post that took the fee and the item but got no
//! `SCAuctionPosted`, a lot posted and not listed, a search nobody answers, a buyout whose money was
//! taken without an answer or whose item never came, a lot that vanished without a result mail,
//! mails that cannot be collected, and error codes nobody expects.
//!
//! The state machine talks to the bot through the small [`Env`] trait so it can be tested with
//! scripted server events; [`Live`] is the implementation around [`Ctx`].
