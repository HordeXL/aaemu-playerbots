//! Prices at the auction house: what to ask for an item, and what is worth buying.
//!
//! Everything here is pure arithmetic on copper amounts, so the goal's decisions can be tested
//! without a server.
//!
//! # What selling costs
//!
//! The server takes a listing fee when a lot is posted (`buyout * 0.01 * (duration + 1)`, never
//! refunded, [`aa_proto::auction::listing_fee`]) and pays the seller 90% of the sale price. A bot
//! that could simply sell to a vendor (`items.refund`, the amount a vendor pays for one item) lists
//! a stack only when the money it will certainly net, `floor(0.9 * buyout) - fee`, beats the vendor
//! by [`MIN_GAIN_PCT`]; the cheapest such buyout is the *floor*. On top of the floor the price
//! follows the market:
//!
//! * with a market ([`Quote`]: the median of the lowest buyouts per item of the lots of the same
//!   item), the bot asks `quote * u%` with `u` between 95 and 99 (a little under the others), but
//!   never less than the floor; when even the floor is clearly above the market (more than
//!   [`OVERPRICED_PCT`] of it) the vendor is the better buyer and the stack is not listed;
//! * without one, the bot asks the middle between what a vendor pays and what a vendor charges
//!   (`items.refund` and `items.price`), or one and a half times the refund when the item has no
//!   shop price.
