//! Where a sale is handed over: a town (at the auctioneer) or Mirage Isle (at the mailbox).
//!
//! The choice is a pure function of the configuration and of what the seller knows about the
//! buyer: a buyer of the same faction near the same town meets in town; one of another faction,
//! one who is far away and one nobody can place (a player who is not in view) meets on Mirage
//! Isle, which every character can enter. The towns' auctioneers stand next to the island's
//! portal doodads, so the portal spawn nearest to a bot is also the nearest town meeting point.
