//! Guilds (the server calls them expeditions): bots found them, recruit, promote, talk in them
//! and leave them, and a real player can ask a bot officer for an invitation.
//!
//! Everything is off until `[guild] enabled`. The pieces:
//!
//! * [`log`]: [`GuildLog`], what a bot knows about its guild (the packets of
//!   [`aa_proto::guild`] feed it through [`GuildState::on_event`]).
//! * [`book`]: [`GuildBook`], the process-wide registry in the hub: a card per bot, the guilds
//!   the bots belong to, the foundings under way (`max_guilds`), the names that are taken, the
//!   invitation and chat pace of each guild.
//! * [`plan`] and [`found`]: the founding. A bot with no guild that has what it takes sends the
//!   coordinator a wish ([`GuildWish`](plan::GuildWish)); `party_size` wishes of one mother
//!   faction become a founding team ([`PartyOrder`](crate::bot::party::PartyOrder) with the
//!   purpose `Guild`); the goal ([`crate::bot::goals::guild`]) runs the [`found::Machine`]:
//!   team, name, creation, dismissal of the team. The server needs no walking: invitations go by
//!   name.
//! * [`life`] and [`duty`]: what a bot in a guild does, whatever goal it runs: answers
//!   invitations (bots of a bot guild; real players only with `accept_player_invites`), recruits,
//!   promotes officers (the owner), hands the guild over before it leaves, and talks.
//! * [`chat`]: the lines, and the whispers of real players that ask for an invitation.
//! * [`names`]: guild names the server's pattern accepts.
//!
//! # Rules the bots keep
//!
//! * A guild is a bot guild when a bot owns it. Bots recruit and promote only in bot guilds.
//! * An owner never leaves a guild leaderless: it hands the guild to another bot of the guild
//!   first (the server leaves the guild without an owner otherwise), and an owner without a
//!   successor stays.
//! * Real players are never expelled and never promoted or demoted by a bot; a bot invites one
//!   only when asked.
//! * Bots invite bots of their own mother faction.
//!
//! The per-bot budget is tight (`size_of::<Bot>() < 3200`): [`GuildState`] is one pointer, and the
//! [`Mem`] behind it is allocated by the first guild packet or the first duty tick with the
//! feature on.
