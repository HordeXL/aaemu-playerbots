//! Choosing a trip: where to launch, where to land, and which waters to stay out of.
//!
//! The launch is the nearest beach with open water in front of it ([`find_shore`]); the landing is
//! a beach near a random open-water point 1 to 3 km from the launch whose sea route is not much
//! longer than the straight line; failing that the trip is a sightseeing loop out to a point at
//! sea and back to the launch beach. Everything is computed on the shared sea map and the terrain
//! grid, with the places hostile sea monsters spawn closed to the planner ([`danger_zones`]).
//!
//! The hull sets the rest ([`TripCfg::ship`]): a clipper or a cutter needs a launch with room for
//! the hull ahead of the beach ([`find_launch`]), a wider margin of open water along the route (on
//! the deep sea mask for the large hulls), rounded corners (the hull turns on a circle of 64 to
//! 216 m) and a berth out at sea ([`Plan::moor`]) instead of the water point a rowboat can reach
//! to within 12 m of the sand.
