//! Companions: bots in the parties of real players (the party feature, goal `companion`).
//!
//! A real player invites a bot, or whispers "inv" to it; the bot joins when it is idle enough, its
//! level fits and this process has not too many companions already, and says no at once
//! otherwise (the server never expires an invitation and a pending one blocks every later one).
//! Once in the party the bot follows the leader, helps in the fights (the combat controller
//! assists the members' targets for any team), announces its role, obeys a closed set of chat
//! commands and, with `follow_into_dungeons`, goes through a dungeon door behind the leader.
//!
//! Layout, pure pieces first (each is tested without a connection):
//!
//! | File | What it is |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `policy.rs` | May the bot join, may it invite: [`policy::judge`] over [`policy::Facts`]. |
//! | `command.rs` | The chat commands ([`command::parse`]), dungeon names, the short lines it says. |
//! | `follow.rs` | Where to stand next to the leader and when to walk ([`follow::decide`]). |
//! | `upkeep.rs` | Role, handing the lead back, leaving ([`upkeep::plan`]). |
//! | `enter.rs` | The machine that follows the leader through a dungeon door ([`enter::Machine`]). |
//! | `duty.rs` | The glue the brain calls every tick: invitations, upkeep, replies, chat. |
//!
//! The goal itself is [`crate::bot::goals::companion`]. Per-bot state is [`Mem`], behind the
//! pointer `BotState::party` already has (the size of a bot is limited); the process-wide count of
//! companions is the hub's [`Board`].
