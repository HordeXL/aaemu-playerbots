//! The farm goal's state machine. A pure function of its state, an [`Input`] (what the bot knows
//! this tick) and the bot's [`FarmMem`], returning [`Act`]s (what the bot should do), so a whole
//! run is tested against a scripted server without a network or a [`Ctx`](crate::bot::ctx::Ctx).
//!
//! A run is one of two jobs:
//!
//! * **plant** ([`Machine::plant`]): `Fetch` (ask the server for the crops the bot has on the
//!   public farms, once per session), `Shop` (walk to the seed vendor and buy) or `Mint` (a GM
//!   command, only when there is no vendor or no money), then `Sow` (draw a free spot, walk next
//!   to it, `CSCreateDoodad`, wait for the crop to appear);
//! * **reap** ([`Machine::harvest`]): `Reap` (walk to the nearest ripe plot, start the harvest skill,
//!   wait for the crop to change, then plant the seeds the harvest gave back on the same spot).
//!
//! The memory ([`FarmMem`]) follows the server's events outside the machine; the machine reads it
//! (which plots exist, which are ripe) and writes the plots it plants and drops. The harvest
//! window ([`FarmMem::harvest_honest`]) is open exactly while a harvest cast is under way.
