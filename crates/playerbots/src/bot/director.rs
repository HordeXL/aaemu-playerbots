//! The LLM director: now and then a bot asks the model what to do next, as a short plan.
//!
//! Optional (`[llm] enabled = true` and `director = true`) and advisory: the brain's own utility
//! scoring stays in charge, and the model only ever chooses among what the bot's own eligibility
//! allows.
//!
//! * **Options.** The model is offered at most [`MAX_OPTIONS`] numbered lines: the goals the
//!   brain's scoring gives a chance right now (best first, without the goals that need GM rights
//!   when those are off) and, next to them, concrete variants the bot can do now: `explore` a
//!   zone it has never been in (from the quest atlas and its journal; reachable, not in a zone at
//!   war and not deadly for its level, the danger test of [`progress::deadly`]), `wander` to the
//!   town of its zone or to its house, `farm wild` (only with `[farm] wild` and an
//!   [`WILD_OUTLAW_MIN`] outlaw streak). A choice maps to [`GoalArgs`] and is started with
//!   [`Brain::queue_with`](super::brain::Brain::queue_with).
//! * **A plan.** The answer ([`pb_llm::Llm::decide`]) is up to `llm.director_plan_steps` steps.
//!   The brain keeps them here and starts the next one whenever a goal ends; each step is checked
//!   again then ([`step_allowed`]) and dropped when it no longer is. A plan is forgotten after
//!   [`PLAN_TTL_MS`], and an operator's or agent's goal command drops it.
//! * **When.** Every `llm.director_interval_secs` (per bot, jittered so the bots do not ask
//!   together), and with `llm.director_triggers` sooner after a [`Trigger`]: a level-up, a death,
//!   a failed goal, a zone the bot has never been in, a plan that runs out. Never two requests of
//!   one bot within `llm.director_min_gap_secs`, at most one in flight, and the global limits
//!   (requests per minute, concurrency, token budget) are the client's; a refused or failed
//!   request changes nothing.
//! * **Memory.** The situation text has the bot's personality, how many zones it has seen and its
//!   last notes, quoted as JSON strings and marked as data. The answer may carry a `note`; it is
//!   filtered like a chat line and kept in the journal (`llm.director_notes`).
//!
//! The functions here are pure (eligibility, options, situation text, plan bookkeeping) or thin
//! readers of the tick context ([`menu`]); the brain owns the timing.
