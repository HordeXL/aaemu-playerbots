//! Social behavior: chat.
//!
//! Not a goal the brain chooses but a duty that runs on every brain tick, whatever the bot is
//! doing ([`Social::tick`], called by the [`Brain`](crate::bot::brain::Brain)).
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! * **Routes the chat inbox.** Whispers and local lines go to the reply logic. System (`-2`) and
//!   notice (`-1`) lines, for example the answer to a GM `/build`, are *not* thrown away: they go
//!   into a small per-bot ring that goals read with [`system_lines`]. Everything else is dropped.
//! * **Answers players.** A whisper to the bot is always a candidate. A local line is a candidate
//!   when it names the bot, or comes from a real player (a character that is not one of ours)
//!   within `social.reply_radius_m` and a dice roll (`social.reply_chance`, scaled by the bot's
//!   chattiness) says yes; of all the bots that hear such a line only the first to claim it
//!   answers. Whispers are answered with a whisper, local lines in local chat.
//! * **Replies** come from the LLM when it is on ([`reply`]: a task off the bot's task, polled on
//!   the tick) and from a small table of persona-flavoured lines ([`canned`]) otherwise or when
//!   the LLM is busy; a jokey bot quips back at small talk now and then ([`humor`]), a crude one
//!   answers coarsely.
//! * **Personalities** ([`style`]): the bot's `chatty`, `joker` and `crude` traits scale how often
//!   it answers what it overhears, how often it speaks unasked, how long it waits between lines,
//!   how many of its lines are jokes and how coarse it is, under the operator's
//!   `[personality] profanity` cap. A chatterbox takes a larger share of the limits below, a
//!   quiet bot hardly speaks.
//! * **Remarks** on what happened to the bot, which the chat notices by itself ([`Tally`]): a
//!   level up, a death or a gank, a quest turned in, a pack sold, a harvest, a house finished, a
//!   bag full of loot; and after the goals the brain reports ([`ChatEvent`]): a duel (won or lost)
//!   and a trade. Bot-to-bot: a hello now and then to a bot standing close by.
//! * **Ambient lines** in local chat while a real player is near (small talk and jokes,
//!   [`lines`], [`humor`]; the LLM may write some of them with `[personality] llm_chatter`), and
//!   from the chattier bots now and then a line on the shout, trade or group-finding channel
//!   (never an advertisement).
//!
//! # Limits that keep it quiet
//!
//! Per bot: a gap between replies, a burst cap, a cap per conversation ([`memory`]), a gap
//! between two unasked lines and at most 1 to 5 unasked lines in 10 minutes, by chattiness;
//! across bots: replies, chatter and ambient lines per minute, channel lines per hour, LLM-written
//! ambient lines per minute, and one answer per overheard line ([`gate::ChatGate`] in the hub).
//! The LLM has its own limits (requests per minute, tokens per day) in `pb-llm`. Unasked lines
//! need a real player within 150 m unless `social.chatter_needs_player` is off.
//!
//! # The language filter
//!
//! Every line, whoever wrote it, passes [`pb_llm::persona::sanitize_chat`] at the bot's level
//! when it is scheduled and once more just before it goes on the wire: commands, links and
//! AI talk are refused, slurs, hate, sexual words, insults and threats too
//! ([`pb_llm::persona::blocked`], also in [`wire_text`] for the lines of the other features), and
//! swearing above the level is softened or the line is dropped. **A line that starts with `/` is
//! never sent** ([`say_packet`], [`whisper_packet`], [`channel_packet`]).
//!
//! The core is [`Social::step`] and [`Social::observe`], free of the tick context so they can be
//! tested with plain values; [`Social::tick`] adapts a [`Ctx`] to them.
