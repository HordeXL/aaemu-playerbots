//! Trade-chat sales: advertisements, buyers and sellers, negotiations (owned by the market
//! feature, goal `market`).
//!
//! [`AdState`] is the bot's memory of what it advertised and who answered. It lives in
//! [`Inner`](super::Inner) (`state.market`) and is driven every brain tick by the market duty
//! (`goals::market::duty`), whatever goal runs:
//!
//! * [`AdState::on_chat`] queues what the bot hears (shouts, trade and group-finding chat, whispers,
//!   see [`hears`]) from the social duty; only lines that talk about buying and selling are kept.
//! * [`AdState::step`] reads the queue and answers: a buyer who replies to the bot's
//!   advertisement gets a quote, a counter-offer, an agreement and the meeting place
//!   ([`talk::Talk`]); the bot answers the advertisements of other bots and of players when it
//!   wants the goods or has them; it posts an advertisement of its own surplus (or of what it
//!   needs) when its turn comes and somebody could read it; limits are per bot
//!   (`ad_interval_secs`) and for the whole process ([`board::Board`]: `max_ads_per_hour`, lines
//!   per minute). Nothing it says is a reply to itself, a command or too long.
//! * An agreed deal ([`Agreed`]) is what the goal ([`crate::bot::goals::market`]) carries out: the
//!   meeting and the trade, which checks the window against the deal
//!   ([`crate::bot::goals::trade::Deal`]).
//!
//! The pure parts: [`grammar`] (what a line says), [`lines`] (what the bots say), [`talk`] (one
//! negotiation), [`price`] (what things cost), [`names`] (item names), [`board`] (what all bots of
//! the process share). Everything here is tested with scripted lines; nothing touches the network.
