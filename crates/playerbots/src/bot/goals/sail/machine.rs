//! The sail goal's state machine: get a scroll, pick a trip, walk to the launch beach, summon the
//! boat, board it, sail the route, land, despawn the boat. A pure function of its state and an
//! [`Input`] (what the bot knows this tick), returning [`Act`]s (what the bot should do), so the
//! whole trip is tested against a scripted server without a network or a [`Ctx`](crate::bot::ctx::Ctx).
//!
//! Phases (see [`Phase`]): `Gear` (the scroll), `Plan` (launch, landing), `Shore` (walk to the
//! launch beach), `Summon` (cast, wait for the slave), `Board` (swim to it, bind), `Sail` (probe the
//! helm, follow the route), `Land` (stop, leave, despawn the boat, come ashore) and `Abort` (the
//! way out of every failure: leave the boat, despawn it, go to the nearest beach). Nothing here
//! leaves a boat behind: every end of the goal passes through [`Machine::stop`].
