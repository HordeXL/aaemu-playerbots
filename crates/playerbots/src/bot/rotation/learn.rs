//! Skill learning and ability unlocks.
//!
//! A character starts with one ability (class tree) and its first skill. As the level grows the
//! bot adds the archetype's second and third ability (`CSSwapAbility` into an empty slot, at the
//! archetype's unlock levels) and learns the skills of its `skill_learn_order` whose ability is
//! active and whose ability level the character has reached (`CSLearnSkill`).
//!
//! The server answers a successful learn with `SCSkillLearned` and a refusal with silence (not
//! enough skill points, ability level too low), so a request that is not answered within
//! [`ANSWER_WAIT_MS`] counts as refused and the skill is left alone until the character has
//! gained a level. One request at a time, [`STEP_GAP_MS`] apart, and only out of combat.
